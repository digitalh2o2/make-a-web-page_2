          <p>I have taken some previous courses regarding the basics of HTML but it was nice to see new tags that I have <b>not</b> seen before</p>

          <p>For example it was nice to see that <em>break</em> works just like <em>paragraph</em> but falls under an <b>inline</b> tag rather than a <b>block</b> tag that paragraph falls under.</p>

          <p>It was alos nice to see the difference between <b>span</b> and <b>div</b> tags as I've only seen in previous material but never defined. One of those courses was <a href="www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>.
          </p>

        <h2>Plans for this course</h2>
      </div>
          <p>I look forward to <em><b>learning</b></em> new material along 
          the way and see how far my potential <b>can</b> go!.</p>

          <p>As I mentioned from my notes in Stage 0, most of the information has been a good review from what I've learned in the past. The most important thing that I took out of it that I never thought about before was picturing and breaking down websites into multiple boxes. Below is a <b>perfect</b> example of what was taught previously in 1.1 and 1.2</p>

          <p>This sort of information will help me think about designing websites. This method will help me approach the larger parts of what is needed to be built first and work my way down to the smallest ones</p>
		  
		  <p>A very crucial piece and great habit programmers should develop early in their careers is making sure to properly indent their code. When adding new elements to your code you should indent, or <em>nest</em>, the element further in. That way, if you need to fix an error or if someone else is reading your code, it'll be easier to read through and correct.</p>

        <h1 id="stage2">My notes for Stage 1.3</h1>
      </div>
          <p>There are a couple of important things to take away from Stage 1.3 which mainly involved CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it helps us avoid <b><em>repetition</em></b> which will save a lot of time for larger websites (as well as headaches). For example, the CSS for this HTML has allowed me to easily make changes for all the separate sections of this page with a few rules as opposed to going through every section manually and adding the code.</p>
            
          <p>It's very important to keep things in order and pay close attention to detail because the most <b>specific</b> rules, or child elements, take priority over their parent element. One must know to keep their code organized and structured properly otherwise with one small typo, it can ruin your document completely. That's why incorporating CSS can save one the trouble of debugging their whole document line by line when they could have separated by sections.</p>
            
          <p>Here are some ways to add style to an HTML.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>For smaller projects you can add <em>style</em> with {} within the <b>head</b> tag</li>
              <li>Separate CSS file sheet. This is the most common method</li>
              <li>Write inline style to each and every code. Bad method and extremely repetitive.</li>
            </ul>
          
    
          <p>Remember to always <b><span class="important">CODE, TEST, REFINE!</span></b></p>
